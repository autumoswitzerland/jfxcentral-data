# Transit Theme

This Java, JavaFX theme, builds upon the lessons and my work with JMetro.

The first inspiration will be Fluent Design (like JMetro) because the vast majority of Desktop users are Windows O.S. 
users but the emphasis will be even more on <ins>not</ins> trying to copy Fluent Design but on actually trying to come up 
with a new theme that picks on the best of Fluent Design as well as on other known themes. From time to time, Iâ€™ll also 
try to come up with original designs where I see it fit.

Transit theme is composed by stylesheets and new skins (the skins are given by the FXSkins library which Transit depends on).

Transit theme is, at the time of writing of this document, targeted at Java 17 (JavaFX 20).
